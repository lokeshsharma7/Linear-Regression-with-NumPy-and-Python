# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself
Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries
Task 2: Load the Data and Libraries
Task 3: Visualize the Data
Task 4: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
Task 5: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
Task 6: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
Task 7: Plotting the Convergence
Task 8: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
Task 9: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
